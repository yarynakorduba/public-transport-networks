# Important

1. We added server side rendering. Type the server url `http://localhost:4000/` to see it working.</li>
2. To name the CSS classes, we use BEM methodology with `__` separator for element and `_` separator for modifier:
 `.Block__element_modifier`
3. We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing the UI components. If you want to see our storybook, go to frontend dir (`cd frontend`) and run `yarn storybook` in the terminal.
