    <p>
      <Trigger>London</Trigger> public transport network. It is really important. Just imagine you need to get to Big Ben. What would you
      use? Of course public transport. So let's figure out what does it mean to be a bus. A bus (archaically also
      omnibus,[1] multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a
      capacity as high as 300 passengers.[2] The most common type of bus is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads
      carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are
      used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge
      a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary
      education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and
      beyond a regular driver's licence.

      What's the use of buses? Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school
      transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are
      privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles. Horse-drawn buses were
      used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first internal
      combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895.[3] Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid
      electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as ones powered by compressed natural gas or
      biodiesel. As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around
      the world.

      Now let's look at busways busway or transitway, is a bus-based public transport system designed to improve
      capacity and reliability relative to a conventional bus system.[2] Typically, a BRT system includes roadways that
      are dedicated to buses, and gives priority to buses at intersections where buses may interact with other traffic;
      alongside design features to reduce delays caused by passengers boarding or leaving buses, or purchasing fares.
      BRT aims to combine the capacity and speed of a metro with the flexibility, lower cost and simplicity of a bus
      system.

      <span id="1" className="anchor" style={{ color: "red" }}>
        the shortest route of Bristol public transport network,
      </span>{" "}
      which describes a high-capacity urban public-transit system with its own right of way, multiple-car vehicles at
      short headways, and longer stop spacing than traditional streetcars and buses. BRT uses buses on a wide variety of
      rights-of-way, including mixed traffic, dedicated lanes on surface streets, and busways separated from traffic.
      The expression "BRT" is mainly used in the Americas and China; in India, it is called "BRTS" (BRT System); in
      Europe and Indonesia, it is often called a "busway"; while in the British Isles, it may be called a "quality bus".

      Critics have charged that the term "bus rapid transit" has sometimes been misapplied to systems that lack most or
      all the essential features which differentiate it from conventional bus services. The term "bus rapid transit
      creep" has been used to describe severely degraded levels of bus service which fall far short of the BRT Standard
      promoted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy and other organizations.

      It was converted from trolley to bus use in 1948. However, the first BRT system in the world was the OC Transpo
      system in Ottawa, Canada. Introduced in 1973, the first element of its BRT system was dedicated bus lanes through
      the city centre, with platformed stops. The introduction of the first exclusive separate busways (termed
      'Transitway') occurred in 1983. By 1996, all of the originally envisioned 31 km Transitway system was in
      operation; further expansions were opened in 2009, 2011, and 2014. As of 2017, the central part of the Transitway
      is being converted to a Light Rail Transit, due to the downtown section being operated beyond its designed
      capacity.[4]

      The second BRT system in the world was the Rede Integrada de Transporte (RIT, integrated transportation network),
      implemented in Curitiba, Brazil, in 1974.[5]:5[6] Most of the elements that have become associated with BRT were
      innovations first suggested by Curitiba Mayor Architect Jaime Lerner.[7][8] Initially just dedicated bus lanes in
      the center of major arterial roads, in 1980 the Curitiba system added a feeder bus network and inter-zone
      connections, and in 1992 introduced off-board fare collection, enclosed stations, and platform-level boarding.

      In the United States, BRT began in 1977, with Pittsburgh's South Busway,[10] operating on 4.3 miles (6.9 km) of
      exclusive lanes. Its success led to the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway in 1983, a fuller BRT deployment
      including a dedicated busway of 9.1 miles (14.6 km), traffic signal preemption, and peak service headway as low as
      two minutes. After the opening of the West Busway, 5.1 miles (8.2 km) in length in 1990, Pittsburghâ€™s Busway
      system is today over 18.5 miles long.

      Bus-only lanes make for faster travel and ensure that buses are not delayed by mixed traffic congestion. A median
      alignment bus-only keeps buses away from busy curb-side side conflicts, where cars and trucks are parking,
      standing and turning. Separate rights of way may be used such as the completely elevated Xiamen BRT. Transit malls
      or 'bus streets' may also be created in city centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prohibiting turns for traffic across the bus lane significantly reduces delays to the buses. Bus priority will
      often be provided at signalized intersections to reduce delays by extending the green phase or reducing the red
      phase in the required direction compared to the normal sequence. Prohibiting turns may be the most important
      measure for moving buses through intersections.
